I recently analyzed a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine using Excel for a detailed breakdown of their sales and trends. By leveraging pivot tables, advanced Excel techniques, and data cleaning methods, I was able to uncover valuable insights that can inform business strategy and menu development! <br><br>

🔍 **Key Insights from My Analysis:**<br>
1️⃣ Hamburgers are the most ordered item, while the Korean Beef Bowl leads in sales! <br>
2️⃣ Chicken Tacos rank the lowest both in orders and contribution to sales. <br>
3️⃣ Italian cuisine emerges as the most popular category, with room for further expansion.<br>
4️⃣ Peak business hours are 12-1 PM and 5-6 PM – great opportunities for promotions and customer engagement!<br><br>

💡** Future Recommendations:**<br>
Focus on developing more Italian-inspired dishes to cater to the high demand.<br>
Explore optimizing the menu by revisiting underperforming items like Chicken Tacos.<br>
It’s amazing how data can unveil trends and help shape business decisions! What’s next? I’ll continue honing my analytics skills, tackling more complex datasets to uncover deeper insights. 🔥
