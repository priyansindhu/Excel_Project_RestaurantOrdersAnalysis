I recently analyzed a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine using Excel for a detailed breakdown of their sales and trends. By leveraging pivot tables, advanced Excel techniques, and data cleaning methods, I was able to uncover valuable insights that can inform business strategy and menu development!

🔍 Key Insights from My Analysis:
1️⃣ Hamburgers are the most ordered item, while the Korean Beef Bowl leads in sales!
2️⃣ Chicken Tacos rank the lowest both in orders and contribution to sales.
3️⃣ Italian cuisine emerges as the most popular category, with room for further expansion.
4️⃣ Peak business hours are 12-1 PM and 5-6 PM – great opportunities for promotions and customer engagement!

💡 Future Recommendations:
Focus on developing more Italian-inspired dishes to cater to the high demand.
Explore optimizing the menu by revisiting underperforming items like Chicken Tacos.
It’s amazing how data can unveil trends and help shape business decisions! What’s next? I’ll continue honing my analytics skills, tackling more complex datasets to uncover deeper insights. 🔥
